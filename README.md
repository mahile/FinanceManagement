# My React & Node Project

This is a full-stack project built with React (with Chakra UI) for the frontend and Node.js (with Express) for the backend.

## Setup Instructions

## Folder Structure

├── package-lock.json       # Versioned dependencies for npm

├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration file

├── .gitignore              # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git

└── README.md               # Project documentation

Server/
├── models/                 # Contains database models (e.g., User model, deposite model)

├── routes/                 # Contains route handlers (API routes)

├── index.js                # Entry point for the backend server (sets up Express, middlewares, routes)

├── package.json            # Project dependencies and scripts

├── package-lock.json       # Versioned dependencies for npm

└── .gitignore              # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git


### Frontend (React with Chakra UI)

1. Navigate to the `vite-project` directory:
   
  cd vite-project
   

2. Install the dependencies:
   
   npm install


3. Run the frontend:
  
   npm run dev
  

   ### Backend (Node.js with Express)

1. Navigate to the `Server` directory:
  
   cd Server
  

2. Install the backend dependencies:
   
   npm install


3. Start the backend:

   node index.js
   

4. The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3000` .

     ## Features Implemented

- **Scalable Architecture**: The architecture is modular and can be easily extended with new features, such as email notifications or advanced user permissions.
